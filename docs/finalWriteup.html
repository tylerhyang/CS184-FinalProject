    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Doodle Jump, a game developed by Lima Sky in 2010, became an quick hit, presenting an infinite length game where
        players could continue to platform, shoot enemies, and climb to new heights. With a rich set of computer
        graphics fundamentals used in the development of this game, we have reimagined the game in a 3D context, porting
        over some of the most beloved features from the original game into a three-dimensional scene. In our project, we
        integrated a custom model player with the ability to rotate camera angles and jump from platform to platform,
        integrated three different enemy polymorphs with different abilities as well as their interactions with the
        player. In addition, we have also developed a shooting mechanic for the player leveraging built-in raycasting
        and collision detection. Additionally, we have integrated custom textures and models using AI generated tools
        such as Stable Diffusion. The purpose of integrating these features is to increase the gameplay difficulty as
        well as providing an interactive third-person “platform-until-you-die” and shooter game while implementing the
        rich computer graphics requirements to result in a smooth and functional game.</p>



    <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
    <h3>Player Movement</h3>
    <p>The primary script we developed, "PlayerMovement," is written in C# and utilizes Unity's built-in physics engine.
        We leveraged the CharacterController component for handling movement and collision detection, which offers
        better performance than Rigidbody for character control.
        We utilized Quaternion and Euler angles for smooth character rotation, ensuring the character's orientation
        always matches its direction of movement. The Mathf.Atan2 function calculates the angle between the player's
        movement direction and the camera's forward direction. This angle is then converted to degrees with
        Mathf.Rad2Deg and added to the camera's y-axis Euler angle. Using Mathf.SmoothDampAngle, we interpolated the
        character's rotation over time, achieving a smooth transition between angles.
        Gravity scaling was implemented by multiplying the default Physics.gravity by a user-defined gravityScale
        variable. This allowed us to customize the gravity strength, improving the feel of our character's jump.
        We also enhanced the standard character jump found in many tutorials by implementing proper collision detection,
        ensuring the player bounces as soon as they touch the ground or an enemy's head. This was achieved using the
        isGrounded property of the CharacterController component.
    </p>

    <h3>Platform Spawner</h3>
    <p>The Random Platform Spawner is a script designed for a 3D Doodle Jump-like game that generates platforms with random positions as the player moves forward and upward. The main goal of the script is to create a dynamic and engaging experience for the player while maintaining smooth gameplay and preventing lag.
        Our approach is based on procedural generation techniques, specifically Perlin Noise, a well-known algorithm introduced by Ken Perlin in 1983. Perlin Noise is a coherent noise function that creates smooth gradients between values, allowing for more natural-looking randomness. It works by interpolating a series of pseudo-random gradient vectors over a grid, resulting in a continuous, non-repeating pattern.
        In the Random Platform Spawner script, we used Perlin Noise in combination with Mathf.Lerp, a Unity function that linearly interpolates between two values based on a weight parameter. Mathf.Lerp takes three arguments: the two values to interpolate and a weight parameter. In our case, the two values are the minimum and maximum platform distances in the x and y directions, and the weight parameter is derived from the Perlin Noise.
        We introduced a perlinWeight parameter to control the amount of smoothing applied by Perlin Noise, which determines the balance between smoothness and randomness in platform positions. By adjusting this parameter, we can fine-tune the level of coherence in platform distribution.
        Our implementation differs from the original Perlin Noise algorithm in that we use a minimal amount of Perlin Noise for slight smoothing, whereas the original algorithm typically generates more complex and detailed patterns.
        The platform spawning and despawning process is managed using a Queue data structure, which helps maintain the platforms in the order they were generated. As the player moves forward and upward, new platforms are enqueued and spawned, while platforms far enough behind and below the player are dequeued and destroyed, ensuring efficient memory usage and preventing lag during gameplay.
    </p>

    <h3>Texture Mapping</h3>
    <p>To generate textures for our 3D Doodle Jump game, we used Stable Diffusion [5], a diffusion based txt2img/img2img
        generator that can generate high-quality textures with controlled inputs. We used it to generate textures for
        the platforms, background, and create initial mockups of the character designs of the game.</p>
    <p>In addition to using AI tools, we also created custom meshes with Blender and downloaded free models from online
        repositories and used them to populate our game world.</p>
    <p>With these custom meshes and textures ready, we imported them into the game and created custom prefabs with
        textured materials. We also edited the hitboxes of several enemy characters to provide a more satisfying jumping
        mechanic.</p>
    <p>Finally, we mapped the game's skybox to a custom textured cube map, which is used to simulate a three-dimensional
        background. By mapping the game's skybox to a custom textured cube map, we were able to create a realistic
        notebook page that added depth to our game world and reproduce the vanilla 2D design in 3D.</p>

    <h3>Hitbox and Enemy Development</h3>
    <p>At the core of each enemy object type is defined by three main interactions: 1) if the player and enemy collide
        with the any face of the enemy aside from the top component, the player will be killed, 2) if the player shoots
        a pellet and the raycast intersects with the enemy, the enemy will be killed 3) if the player manages to land on
        the top of the bounding box of the enemy, the enemy will be killed. </p>
    <p>To integrate this, we needed to implement ways of detecting collisions. The most effective and consistent method
        was to designate each enemy object with two hitboxes: head and body. These hitboxes are collision-less
        structures, leveraging Unity’s Collision packages, specifically Collision.OnTriggerEnter (1). In prior sandbox
        testing, we noted that Unity’s Collision.OnCollisionEnter function would have inconsistent results due to how
        collisions were sampled, particularly prevalent with fast moving unity objects. In order to improve collision
        recognition accuracy, we designated two collision-less trigger volumes on the enemy: head and body. The head
        component has Collision.IsTrigger enabled which allowed for the detection of the movement through a trigger
        volume (2). Upon entering the head trigger volume, the Collision.OnTriggerEnter function would run, which would
        lead to destroying the enemy object in the scene (1). Likewise, we were able to apply the same logic to the body
        component to register kiling the enemy if the entering object is a player. Through manual testing, we noticed
        that the accuracy of enemy collision detection increased from 64% to 92% (using 100 trials).</p>
    <p>After implementing the base enemy logic, we introduced polymorphism in the form of three new enemy types, the
        most complex and noteworthy being the chaseEnemy. The chase enemy has two main functionalities: 1) chasing a
        player that are chaseDistance units away from the player (defaulted to 10 for our gameplay mechanics) 2)
        alerting other chase enemies that are alertDistance units away from the attacking chase enemy (defaulted to 20
        units). To speed up this section, we constructed a bounding sphere around the enemy using the function
        Physics.OverlapSphere which would create a set of gameObjects that are within a sphere of radius alertDistance
        centered at the enemy. These Chase Enemies will now begin to chase after the player.</p>
    <p>For alert propagation, we noticed that the initial schema would lead to the signal propagation extremely far,
        causing chase enemies long distance away from the player to also chase after to player. In order to dampen the
        alert signal, we would only allow for enemies that are within chaseDistance units away from the player to
        trigger the alert, even if they are tracking the player. Using the concept of limiting search space from BVHs
        (bounding volume hierarchy), we used the precalculated list of gameObjects from the previous section and compute
        their distance from the player instead of calculating based on all objects in the scene. Drawing from the ideas
        of acceleration structures like BVH, we were able to significantly reduce the search space and allow for reduce
        compute time performed at each frame.</p>

    <h3>Ray Casting</h3>
    <p>The other technical feature implemented was raycasting. Raycasting is a way to cast a ray in a given direction
        from a point and determining whether it intersects with objects in a scene. Intuitively, we were able to use
        this as the main component of shooting in our game. For our shooting feature, we first modified the player model
        to have an invisible rigid body structure centered at the mouth of our doodle mesh model. When the player
        interacts with the doodle and triggers the shoot action, we launch a projectile into the world space, using
        Physics.Raycast to determine what and when it intersects with the world (4). In the case that the projectile
        intersects with an enemy, we will destroy the intersected enemy and remove it from the scene. Using raycasting
        allows for computationally less expensive results than launching a projectile into the world and checking at
        each frame what it intersects with in the scene, therefore allowing for a less significant dip in framerate</p>



    <h2>Problems Encountered</h2>
    <h3>Player Movement</h3>
    <p>One issue we encountered was the character's jittery rotation when changing directions quickly. We resolved this problem using the Mathf.SmoothDampAngle function, which smoothly interpolates the rotation over a specified time (turnSmoothTime).
        Another challenge was ensuring the character's jump felt natural while also bouncing off the ground and enemy heads. We addressed this by using the isGrounded property of the CharacterController component and adjusting the gravityScale and jumpHeight variables to fine-tune the character's movement.
    </p>

    <h3>Platform Spawner</h3>
    <p>One problem we faced was adjusting the Perlin Noise parameters to achieve the desired platform distribution. We tackled this by introducing a perlinWeight parameter, which allowed us to fine-tune the balance between randomness and smoothness in platform positions.
        Another issue was ensuring that platforms did not spawn partially inside other platforms. We addressed this by implementing a collider overlap check using Physics.OverlapBox, which prevented overlapping platforms from being generated.
    </p>

    <h3>Texture Mapping</h3>
    <p>One of the main problems we encountered for texture mapping was the difficulty of creating textures that looked
        natural and followed the design of the original 2D game. While Stable Diffusion is able to generate high quality
        textures, many of the initial generations look too realistic. Since our game is about Doodle Jump, we decided to
        stick to a more coherent, clay-made/play doh style when regenerating our in game textures. We also used
        Controlnet [6] to better confine the look of the textures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another problem we encountered was the difficulty of creating custom meshes that were optimized for performance.
        We found that some of our custom meshes were too complex (very high poly) and caused performance issues. To
        overcome this problem, we used Blender's optimization tools to simplify the meshes and reduce their polygon
        count, and resorted to rectangular hitboxes in Unity to reduce computation problems in collision detection. This
        solution worked quite well for us, and provided a much smoother gaming experience in our testing.
    </p>

    <h3>Hitbox and Enemy Development</h3>
    <p>In prior sandbox testing, we noted that Unity’s Collision.OnCollisionEnter function would have inconsistent
        results due to how collisions were sampled, particularly prevalent with fast moving unity objects. By shifting
        over to collision detection through trigger volume hitboxes, we were able to significantly increase the accuracy
        of detecting collisions and preventing enemies from persisting when a player’s jump should kill the enemy.
        Through two rounds of testing using 100 static enemies spawned, we were able to increase the detection of
        collisions from 64% to 92%, improving the quality of the game and it’s interaction with enemies.
    </p>



    <h2>Lesson Learned</h2>
    <h3>Player Movement</h3>
    <p>Throughout the development process, we learned the importance of utilizing built-in Unity components and functions, such as CharacterController and Mathf.SmoothDampAngle, to achieve smooth and efficient character movement. We also discovered the value of customizing physics properties like gravityScale to create a more immersive gameplay experience.</p>

    <h3>Platform Spawner</h3>
    <p>From this project, we learned the importance of using procedural generation techniques, such as Perlin Noise, to create more engaging and visually appealing game environments. We also learned how to balance randomness and smoothness in platform positions using interpolation and weight parameters. Additionally, we discovered the value of collision detection in ensuring the proper functioning of game elements.</p>

    <h3>Texture Mapping</h3>
    <p>Generating textures for a 3D Doodle Jump game requires a lot of experimentation and iteration. It is essential to
        have a clear vision of the game's art style and to continually test different textures and meshes until you find
        the right balance of performance and visual appeal.</p>
    <p>Using AI tools like Stable Diffusion can save a lot of time and effort, but it is important to keep in mind that
        the generated textures may require some tweaking to fit your specific needs. It is also important to make sure
        the meshes in game match the textures. </p>
    <p>We also learned to adopt simplified rectangular hitboxes. Using a simple square hitbox instead of one that wraps
        around a high poly mesh can reduce the number of calculations needed to check for collisions. This can help to
        improve the game's performance by reducing the amount of compute resources required to handle collision
        detection.
    </p>

    <h3>Hitbox and Enemy Development</h3>
    <p>Through the build process of our game, we noticed that Unity was able to provided a rich API to allow for the
        code that was needed to be minimal and concise. Built in functions allowed for otherwise complex features such
        as initializing bounding regions and raycasting to be minimized to a few function calls. Furthermore, we learned
        a lot about the niche features of Unity, especially trigger volumes for increasing detection accuracy as well as
        how we could use disjoint combinations of trigger volumes to allow for various combinations of interactions.
        Using this understanding, for future game development, we hope to investigate how we can perform sequences of
        trigger volume interactions to perform modularly constructed chain events within a game scene.</p>
